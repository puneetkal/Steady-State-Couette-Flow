Steady-state Couette flow refers to the flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid between two parallel plates, where one plate is stationary, and the other is moving at a constant velocity. The flow is driven solely by the motion of the moving plate, without any applied pressure gradient.

Key Characteristics:
Parallel Plates: The fluid is confined between two infinite, parallel plates. The bottom plate is stationary, and the top plate moves with a constant velocity

 .

Steady-State: The term "steady-state" means that the flow properties (like velocity) do not change with time. Once the flow is fully developed, the velocity profile remains constant over time.

Laminar Flow: The flow is assumed to be laminar, meaning the fluid moves in parallel layers without turbulence. Each layer of fluid moves smoothly relative to adjacent layers.

No Pressure Gradient: In Couette flow, there is no pressure difference driving the flow along the length of the plates. The flow is purely driven by the shear force exerted by the moving plate.

Velocity Profile: The velocity of the fluid varies linearly from zero at the stationary plate to

  at the moving plate. This linear profile results from the balance between viscous forces in the fluid and the shear imposed by the moving plate.
